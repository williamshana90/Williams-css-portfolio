			<h3>Bridge to IT Careers</h3>
	<p>For this project I was to create a logo for the job fair known as Bridge to IT Careers. I used color and type that I felt was modern and had a technological feel to it. Using the imagery of bodies I created a wifi symbol to represent the careers involving web access.</p>
